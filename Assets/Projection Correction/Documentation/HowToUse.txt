Projection Correction is a Post Effect that counters the distortion that appears away from the center of the screen, 
as a result of the way the scene is rendered on a flat plane. 
The higher the field of view, the more this is visble.


Usage:

Mostly usefull for when rendering screenshots with a large field of view that might be cropped in several ways, 
or that need to be combined with different screenshots. 
Generally not really usefull for use ingame.

It always only corrects horizontally or vertically. 
(It can't do both at the same time, because that's impossible)


It has 2 modes:

- Full Correction
basically acts as if the scene is projected on a cylinder, that is then unfold onto a plane.  
(rather than projecting straight onto a plane)
Rotating the camera either horizontally or vertically (depends on the setup) clearly shows what this does, 
as everything on screen will remain the exact same shape, it will only slide in or out of view. 
(because of this, the effect is usefull for stitching together screenshots for a 360 view)

- Simple Correction
only corrects the stretching that appears away from the center of the view.
Less radical than the Full Correction.

Setup:

- select the camera in the scene
- select Component > Image Effects > Projection Correction to add this effect to the camera
- parameters:
	- Horizontally: determines wether to correct horizontally or vertically
	- Simple: determines which correction algorithm (mode) to use
	- Intensity: a value between 0 and 1, determines the strength of the effect: 0 is no effect, 1 is full effect.
